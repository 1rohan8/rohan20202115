<br><u><font size=5 color=green >Topic=“Lamb to the Slaughter” by Roald Dahl</font></u>
<br><br><font size=5 color=black>While not exactly a philosophical or political tale like our first two examples, this twisty short story from Dahl does delve into some shady moral territory.
<br><hr>We are introduced to Mary Maloney: a loving wife and dedicated homemaker.
<br><hr>In just a few short paragraphs describing how she welcomes her husband home, Dahli makes us sympathize with Mary — before a rash act turns her life upside down and takes the reader with her on a dark journey.
<br><hr>For those who haven’t read it, we won’t spoil the rest. 
<br><hr>However, it’s safe to say that Dahl serves up a fiendish twist on a platter.<hr>
